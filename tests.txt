1. Content server sends incorrect json format: get 500
2. Content server sends empty PUT request: get 204
3. Messages received contain no valid lamport clock
Aggregation server remove items if a content server has not communicated for 30 seconds
5. test if the lamport clock has been correctly updated
6. Automated testing: have content server serving weather file 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, etc. Each file is populated with random data.
7. test Client:
    7.1 test found weather station, all weathers, can't find weather station
8. Show all error codes
9. show there is no race condition when the weather data is being updated
10. Show that removing old entries is working:
    a. server 1 sends data
    b. client 1 get data
    c. server 1 disconnect. Wait for 30 seconds
    d. client 1 gets data again ==> should be empty.



edge cases:
1. client ask for a station that does not exist
